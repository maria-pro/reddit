Mentally, I feel like someone who lost someone close and always in sorrow? When I go out to work, workout, grocery. I never smile or greet people anymore. It became my habit.

2022-10-09,1665293869,Ive asked God for too many last chances,"Started gambling during pandemic, due to a youtuber who did it. It was not a famous youtuber, and he would always ask for donations to gamble. The idea of gambling has always sickened me, I never thought it would hook me up.

I come from a family who despise gambling very hardly and I could never admit to them what I have done. Every month is the same thing, get paid and lose everything.

Now I have about 4k in credit card debt and I know its not a huge amount compared to what Ive read here, but every month I stay with 0 bucks on me. Too much money lost, too much money that couldve been saved.

I feel like throwing up just by looking at a evolution roulette croupiers face. Its my favourite game and even still knowing its completely rigged, it just gives me the sensation of hope everytime. Maybe thats the most dangerous feeling for a gambler, hope.

Im from brazil and online gambling is basically everywhere here, have banned myself from many websites, but I manage to always figure a new one out every damn time.

Hell, here I am today. Zero bucks for the rest of the month, zero balls to tell my parents or girlfriend about the situation, in which I dont expect to get any help for, just wanted to get this out of my chest.

In my 7 years of gambling, I learned lots of things.
I am lucky to be only few hundred euros down, I had a pretty good run. 
But for me, it is not the money problem. Problem is my life.

I want to make easy money with gambling. 
But the truth is far from it.

1. I am always on my phone. First thing I woke up, i check my phone for my bets and my future bets.

2. My mood changes a lot. I have lots of mood swings and bad mood when i gamble compared to when I dont.

3. I lost perspective of money. It is hard for me to pay 100Â¬ for new shoes or dinner, but I can place 200Â¬ bet no problem on some random game...

""I'm a professional gambler, I make a lot betting sports - can I borrow some money?""

Most if not all compulsive gamblers really want to gamble for the escape feeling it provides and in order to achieve that feeling you need money to fuel the fire. Lots of money. 

Math is fact not fiction, you can't beat the math of gambling and it is an expensive process to get to this conclusion.

2022-10-08,1665248165,Checking back in,"Hi everyone,

Haven't wrote anything in this group in over a year. Was just reading my old posts and am not totally happy with my progress with gambling. 

Do I lose as much as before? No. But I still feel ashamed because I have had relapses and gambling is still always lingering. 

For the ones who think they can just gamble here and there, if you are an addict, it is very tough. I will binge when I gamble, and most of the time not stop until I'm down a good amount. 

I am 30 with 10cc debt. Probably down 60-70k in my ten years of gambling. Yes, that seems like alot but that number will only get bigger if I continue. I have an amazing life. Great girlfriend, and family, lots of friends, great job. It's almost like everything is so good I need to make myself feel shitty sometimes gambling. 

I hadn't gambled in months but relapsed in the last couple days. Lost about 1k. I was up but of course didn't stop. There's no amount that will make me stop. I am taking every measure possible at this point to cut out all access to gambling. Cut up my debit card, blocked all access to gambling websites and will be giving money to my girlfriend and keeping some cash. Literally no way I can gamble because I don't trust myself. I know in a month or two I'll get the urge to gamble. Really hope this is the last time.

I owe 10k in loans which is wayyyy too much to overcome with my small income. It makes me sick. I wish someone would say hey you dont have to pay off these loans if you can prove you wont gamble ever again. I would made the agreement so quick. 

The sad thing is is that I gamble through a specific online app. I tried to permanently close my account last year before I had any huge losses. A few weeks after I tried to close my account for good I contacted them because I had a few bucks left in my account. They said there was a mistake and my account was never officially closed so I started gambling again. And then lost everything. I wish that never happened.
